distel 3.0a -- Distributed Emacs Lisp for Erlang.
------------------------------------------------------------

This package provides a library for Emacs<->Erlang communication plus
a growing suite of tools built on top of it, including a debugger
front end.

Once you do the INSTALL procedure, you'll automatically use an
erlang-extended minor mode when you edit files. By typing "C-h m"
(describe-mode) you can see what it has to offer, and explore from
there.

As a small spoiler, here's the current mode description:

  Erlang-Extended minor mode (indicator EXT):
  Extensions to erlang-mode for communicating with a running Erlang node.

  C-c C-d l       - List all Erlang processes ("pman").
  M-.             - Jump to the definition of a function call (dynamic TAGS).
  M-,             - Go back from the last function definition we jumped to.
  C-c C-d :       - Evaluate an erlang expression from the minibuffer.
  C-c C-d p       - Profile (with fprof) an expression from the minibuffer.
  C-c C-d i       - Toggle debug interpreting of the module.
  C-c C-d b       - Toggle a debugger breakpoint at the current line.
  C-c C-d m       - Popup the debugger's process monitor buffer.

Hope you enjoy, and please send hacks or feedback to luke@bluetail.com!

PS: The "dynamic TAGS" with M-. and M-, is the coolest bit!

Compatibility notes:

  The profiler front end requires >= R8B (to get fprof)
  The debugger front end requires >= R8B-1

  Distel itself is tested with GNU Emacs 20.x and 21.x, and XEmacs
  21.x. Snapshots from CVS may sometimes only work with GNU Emacs 21
  (or, of course, not work at all :-))
