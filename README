distel -- Distributed Emacs Lisp for Erlang.

Installation steps:

1. Do a "make" (NOTE: if you use xemacs, edit elisp/Makefile first to
   use the right compiler.)
2. Copy "c/dec32" somewhere into your path
3. Add the "erl/" directory to your erlang code path, by adding a line
   to your ~/.erlang like:
       code:add_pathz("/path/to/distel/erl").
4. Add the "elisp/" directory to your emacs load path and have it
   loaded on startup, by adding lines to your ~/.emacs like:
      (add-to-list 'load-path "/path/to/distel/elisp")
      (require 'erl)

Recommended:

5. You can setup the "extended" erlang mode, which gives you some more
   commands. You can load this mode with:

    (require 'erlang-mode-ext)

   And then enable it by putting this into your erlang-mode hook:

     (erlang-extended-mode t)

   If you don't already have an erlang-mode hook, the complete code is:

     (add-hook 'erlang-mode-hook 'my-erlang-mode-hook)
     (defun my-erlang-mode-hook ()
       (erlang-extended-mode t))

   Then when you edit an erlang file you should see "EXT" in the
   mode-line to say that you're in the extended mode. Using "C-h m"
   (describe-mode) you can find the available commands, all of which
   are prefixed with "C-c C-d".

That's all! Now you can use commands like "M-x erl-process-list".
