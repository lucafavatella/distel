distel -- Distributed Emacs Lisp for Erlang.

Installation steps:

1. Do a "make" (NOTE: if you use xemacs, edit elisp/Makefile first to
   use the right compiler.)
2. Copy "c/dec32" somewhere into your path
3. Add the "erl/" directory to your erlang code path, by adding a line
   to your ~/.erlang like:
       code:add_pathz("/path/to/distel/erl").
4. Add the "elisp/" directory to your emacs load path and have it
   loaded on startup, by adding lines to your ~/.emacs like:
      (add-to-list 'load-path "/path/to/distel/elisp")
      (require 'erl)

That's all - now "M-x erpc" and "M-x erl-process-list" should work.
