* Build and install

Autoconf and portability to non-GNU systems is a bit of a mystery to
me, so nic build & install will happen gradually. Contributions from
people on non-GNU systems would be especially appreciated.

- Manual override for which Emacs to use in ./configure
- Make all code byte-compile cleanly
- Autoloads

* Debugger
- Visual breakpoint markers

* Profiler
- Tree-view, like OptimizeIt for Java
