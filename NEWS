Version 3.0:

	Lots and lots and lots.

	Dynamic TAGS, debugger, profiler, shell-cum-scratchpad, and
	generally "end-user" applications.
	
	Substantial improvements to the programming interface too,
	particularly eliminating the ugly `tuple' tag.

	Thanks are due to David Wallin (!), Torbjörn Törnkvist, and
	Darius Bacon (so far..) for hacks and ideas, and all the good
	sports here at Bluetail for beta testing :-)

Version 2.0:

	Major additions are pattern matching and `erl-receive'. This
	has simplified the programming interface a lot, making
	`erl-mailbox' become undocumented and `erl-continue' be
	reclassified as an ``internal'' function. All existing
	programs can be updated to be much neater. The actual changes
	are backwards compatible, even though some things have
	disappeared from the documentation.

	Ported to XEmacs (21.1).

	Many thanks to Vladimir Sekissov, Darius Bacon, and Vlad
	Dumitrescu for code and advice on this release.
