Version 3.2 (unreleased):

	Completion of module and function names. So list:keyso
	completes to lists:keysort, etc. Bound to M-TAB and (since
	some window managers take that) M-?. Also has popups for
	ambiguous completions and all that good stuff. REALLY NICE!

        Group for Customization (M-x customize), so customizable
        variables can be configured interactively. It's in
        Programming->Tools->Distel.

        More faithful tags-compliance (i.e. prompting for which tag to
        follow after M-.) optionally available, via the (Customizable)
        `distel-tags-compliant' variable (thanks Martin Bjorklund.)

	Improved "Interactive Session" support. Now C-j evaluates the
	previous expression and inserts the result in-line, and C-M-x
	evaluates a function definition and prints the result as a
	message.

	Improved process-manager support, with many small UI
	enhancements: 'u' updates the list, fewer buffers are created,
	better errors when inspecting dead processes, ...

	EXIT signals are now generated for remote processes when the
	link goes down. This solves some long-standing problems like
	the debug monitor hanging if you restart the node you were
	debugging on.

Version 3.1:

	Compatibility with R9.

	New and incompatible pattern syntax:
          [foo Bar] becomes ['foo bar].
	In other words, symbols without quotes are now variables, even
	if they're lower case.

	References can now be sent and received, and also created with
	(erl-make-ref).

	Greatly improved support for helping the debugger find the
	code for the modules you want to interpret, courtesy of Mats
	Cronqvist <etxmacr@cbe.ericsson.se>.

	Automated bug reporting with "M-x report-distel-problem",
	which generates an email template addressed to the mailing
	list, populated with some trace information.

	M-. (erl-find-source-under-point) doesn't RPC on local
	function lookups, making it faster. M-* now does the same as
	M-, (jump back from a function definition), since it is more
	consistent with TAGS. (M-, still works too.)

Version 3.0:

	Lots and lots and lots.

	Dynamic TAGS, debugger, profiler, shell-cum-scratchpad, and
	generally "end-user" applications.
	
	Substantial improvements to the programming interface too,
	particularly eliminating the ugly `tuple' tag.

	Thanks are due to David Wallin (!), Torbjörn Törnkvist, and
	Darius Bacon (so far..) for hacks and ideas, and all the good
	sports here at Bluetail for beta testing :-)

Version 2.0:

	Major additions are pattern matching and `erl-receive'. This
	has simplified the programming interface a lot, making
	`erl-mailbox' become undocumented and `erl-continue' be
	reclassified as an ``internal'' function. All existing
	programs can be updated to be much neater. The actual changes
	are backwards compatible, even though some things have
	disappeared from the documentation.

	Ported to XEmacs (21.1).

	Many thanks to Vladimir Sekissov, Darius Bacon, and Vlad
	Dumitrescu for code and advice on this release.
