Version 2.0:

	Major additions are pattern matching and `erl-receive'. This
	has simplified the programming interface a lot, and made
	`erl-mailbox' to become undocumented and `erl-continue' be
	reclassified as an ``internal'' function. All existing
	programs can be updated to be much neater. The actual changes
	are backwards compatible, even though some things have
	disappeared from the documentation.

	Many thanks to Vladimir Sekissov and Darius Bacon for code and
	advice on this release.
