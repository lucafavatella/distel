Version 3.0: (Work in progress)

	Debugger, dynamic TAGS, and generally "end-user" applications.
	
	Thanks are due to David Wallin, Torbjörn Törnkvist, and Darius
	Bacon (so far..) for hacks and ideas.

Version 2.0:

	Major additions are pattern matching and `erl-receive'. This
	has simplified the programming interface a lot, making
	`erl-mailbox' become undocumented and `erl-continue' be
	reclassified as an ``internal'' function. All existing
	programs can be updated to be much neater. The actual changes
	are backwards compatible, even though some things have
	disappeared from the documentation.

	Ported to XEmacs (21.1).

	Many thanks to Vladimir Sekissov, Darius Bacon, and Vlad
	Dumitrescu for code and advice on this release.
