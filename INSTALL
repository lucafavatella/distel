Installation
------------

1. Build and install the software in the usual way:
     ./configure && make && [sudo] make install

   If you checked out from CVS, you'll have to run 'autoconf' first,
   to create 'configure'.

   If you use XEmacs but the configure script detects 'emacs', you
   should do "make emacs=xemacs" for both the compile and install
   steps.

[The following two steps can be done manually, or you can just do
"make config_install" instead. It will append these lines to your
~/.emacs and ~/.erlang (but only if they aren't already there). I
ain't touchin' yer dotfiles without permission.]

2. To have Distel's erlang support libraries available in all your
   nodes, add this line to your ~/.erlang:

     code:add_pathz("/usr/local/share/distel/ebin").

  (If you used an install prefix other than /usr/local, change that
  line appropriately.)

3. To automatically enable the erlang-extended-mode for editing Erlang
   files, add this to your ~/.emacs:

     (require 'erlang-mode-ext)

     (defun distel-erlang-mode-hook ()
       (erlang-extended-mode t))

     (add-hook 'erlang-mode-hook 'distel-erlang-mode-hook)

And you should be all set! README says how to get started.

============================================================

Special notes for Mac OSX:

David Wallin reports the following procedure to setup Distel to work
on an OSX machine with no network connection:

1. Start NetInfo Manager.app (in /Applications/Utilities)
2. From NetInfo Manager, select the directory path
   "/machines/localhost" and mark property "name" and (and anytime
   before here: click on the lock and enter the password) choose
   "Append Value" from the "Directory" menu.
3. Enter your machine name as the appended value and Save.

This procedure is like putting "127.0.0.1 <hostname>" into /etc/hosts
on a UNIX machine. It's necessary so that Emacs can open sockets to
the localhost via the hostname part of a nodename without talking to
DNS.
